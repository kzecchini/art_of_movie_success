# art_of_movie_success

This repository contains work focused on using artistic merits of film as features to predict box office success. First, Box Office Mojo and Cinemetrics were scraped for relevent intformation, and the two data sources were merged on film name and year. For now, the models focus on average shot length (asl) and runtime to predict domestic total gross (dtg). These features are weak predictors of box office success compared to other features, such as budget. The final model uses asl, runtime, and budget in a linear ridge regression with an r^2 coefficient of ~0.30. It would be interestting so see how asl relates to other metrics of success, such as IMDB rating or MetaScore. Additionally, other quantifiable metrics of film such as color could provide additional features to include in a future model.
